Based on the provided weather data and weather query response, generate a structured JSON object representing the video creation flow. This JSON should include multiple scenes, each containing the following elements:
1. Intro Scene

    type: Set as "intro".
    duration: Duration of the intro scene (e.g., 5 seconds).
    text: A brief introduction to the video (e.g., "Weather Recap for [time period or location]"). Ensure it dynamically incorporates the period from the weather query response.

2. Data Visualization Scenes

Each data visualization scene should include:

    type: Set as "chart".
    chart:
        Title of the chart (e.g., "Weather Data for [Month]").
        A description summarizing the data being shown.
        Define the data categories: "temperature", "humidity", "rainfall", and "air_pollution", with corresponding values. Omit hardcoded data; instead, placeholder keys (e.g., values, labels, colors) should be used for dynamic rendering.
    summary: A short analysis based on the chart's data, such as:
        Hottest day.
        Coldest day.
        Most rainy day.
        Any notable trends or anomalies.

3. Structure

    Include multiple scenes to handle each data segment (e.g., "September 2024", "October 2024").
    Each scene should include detailed information for all categories.
    For example:
        "temperature" should highlight the highest and lowest temperatures.
        "rainfall" should highlight days with significant precipitation.
        "air_pollution" should include any notable changes, such as spikes caused by environmental factors.

4. JSON Structure

Use the following structure:

{
  "scenes": [
    {
      "type": "intro",
      "duration": 5,
      "text": "Weather Recap for September and October 2024"
    },
    {
      "type": "chart",
      "chart": {
        "title": "Weather Data for September 2024",
        "categories": [
          { "label": "Temperature",  "color": "PLACEHOLDER" },
          { "label": "Humidity",  "color": "PLACEHOLDER" },
          { "label": "Rainfall",  "color": "PLACEHOLDER" },
          { "label": "Air Pollution",  "color": "PLACEHOLDER" }
        ]
      },
      "summary": {
        "hottest_day": "PLACEHOLDER_DATE",
        "coldest_day": "PLACEHOLDER_DATE",
        "most_rainy_day": "PLACEHOLDER_DATE",
        "details": "PLACEHOLDER_FOR_SUMMARY"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "chart",
      "chart": {
        "title": "Weather Data for October 2024",
        "categories": [
          { "label": "Temperature",  "color": "PLACEHOLDER" },
          { "label": "Humidity",  "color": "PLACEHOLDER" },
          { "label": "Rainfall",  "color": "PLACEHOLDER" },
          { "label": "Air Pollution",  "color": "PLACEHOLDER" }
        ]
      },
      "summary": {
        "hottest_day": "PLACEHOLDER_DATE",
        "coldest_day": "PLACEHOLDER_DATE",
        "most_rainy_day": "PLACEHOLDER_DATE",
        "details": "PLACEHOLDER_FOR_SUMMARY"
      }
    }
  ]
}

    Replace PLACEHOLDER keys with appropriate dynamic values based on the provided data.
    Include no hardcoded data or unnecessary API fetchesâ€”just structure and placeholders.
